## Summary
"Global Policy" aims to provide a better understanding of the policy making process surrounding any particular topic by providing decision makers insights into three key areas.

* A broad overview of resolutions passed related to the chosen topic and interest in the topic over time.

* A deeper analysis into the behavior of any particular country with respect to the resolutions found. This includes comparison of voting patterns with other countries, to find like-minded nations which tend to cast the same vote on the given topic, as well countries which generally oppose the vote cast by the chosen country.

* A detailed look into any one of the resolutions found, so that data such as the date on which it was passed, as well as how the member countries voted on the resolution is easily accessible, along with a link to the entire resolution text if the user wishes to analyse in even deeper detail.

The analysis is presented such that the decision maker can easily navigate from analysis of one aspect to another to gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject.
